# SCRUM MEETING DOCUMENTATION

### **Sprint 1 Planning Meeting:**

Date: 3/20/2024
Time: 10:30 AM 
Place: Zachry Engineering Building

Discussion Summary/Breakdown:

In this meeting, team 902-3 of CSCE 331 gave introductions to each other, and shared each personâ€™s technical strengths and weaknesses. We have also discussed the tech stack we plan on using.

We have elected to hold Rushil Jayant as the SCRUM master, as his duties include planning/leading scrum meetings, keeping teams on track, as well as helping everyone during difficulties in development.

In terms of tech stack, we planned on using the Django web development framework, with Vue.js for components in the different parts of the website. As we are using Python for our coding library, we plan on using the pytest and selenium libraries for testing our code as we go through a test driven approach.

All other team members who are not the SCRUM master, become the role of full stack web developer, and we will be using the Agile project management methodology to split our tasks in Github Projects using a Kanban board.

# SCRUM MEETING DOCUMENTATION

### **Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting:**

Date: 4/1/2024
Time: 10:30 AM 
Place: Zachry Engineering Building

Discussion Summary/Breakdown:

In this meeting, team 902-3 of CSCE 331 reviewed what we should do better from the Sprint 1. We have decided as a team that we did good on some things and could improve in many places in the project.

Specifically, we were most proud of the fact that we have been able to use the Agile Project management framework to the best of our ability. In Particular, we have been able to assign each other tasks and responsibilities that were able to streamline deliverables. Furthermore, we use this framework to ensure that we met our sprint goal and over 70% of the sprint backlog.

We believe that we could have improved on the fact that we could have reached out for help earlier in the process. Specifically, we could reach out to instructional staff on some technical difficulties early on so that not all tasks are done at the last minute. Also, we should have moved towards a more shared ownership mindset for the project as that will make sure that all team members double check our progress is on pace.

### **Sprint 2 Planning Meeting:**

Date: 4/3/2024
Time: 10:30 AM 
Place: Zachry Engineering Building

Discussion Summary/Breakdown:

In this meeting, team 902-3 of CSCE 331 moved on from the last sprint review and analyzed the remaining items in the sprint backlog. Specifically, we wanted to make sure that the things that were partially complete are now fully and completely finished in the Sprint 2. We also updated our product backlog with more refined project meetings, and had more clearer stories on Github.

Given that last time, our project was made with separate and independent components with the backend database and the frontend disconnected. We planned on our goal for Sprint 2 being to connect the frontend and backend together, as well as getting the APIs working to add more functionality to the application. 

For the next couple of weeks, we planned that the Scrum master would be in charge of helping everyone out in different ways as well as being more aware of project roles and responsibilities. The SCRUM master will also be responsible for quality assurance.

In terms of the menu boards, Rahul has promised to make a new customer menu board.

For the Database, Diego has said that he is going to make sure that he can implement the templates for the CRUD, and improve from previous versions and weeks of progress.

Diego is still working on the code for the Database operations and he finds that Django was a challenge, also to connect with Vercel. Riley was updating the Vercel and the group discussed the deployment of the software to the tool, and how it could be done correctly.

We also discussed that Rushilâ€™s responsibilities is to implement the weather API, and Diego is now going to work on translation. Rushil explained the need to test the code as well as make it consistent, and requested the help of multiple team members to work on the Django connection with the weather api.

### **Sprint 2 Retrospective Meeting:**

Date: 4/15/2024
Time: 10:30 AM 
Place: Zachry Engineering Building

Discussion Summary/Breakdown:

In this meeting, team 902-3 of CSCE 331 reviewed what we should do better from the Sprint 2. We have decided as a team that we did good on some things and could improve in many places in the project.

We thought that we made several technical improvements since the last iteration of the project, but as a team, our project completion velocity could have been improved significantly. Ideally in this sprint we wanted the backend and the frontend to be connected so that changes on the front end would be reflected in the backend. Even though we made a working version of this, where the backend was local, we would have wanted it to have been hosted online through Vercel if we had not run into technical issues at the last minute. We still finished over 70% of the tasks that we set out for this sprint.

As a group, we could have improved significantly if we had figured out that Vercel is not the best platform to deploy both the frontend and backend, and that we could have explored other solutions in this regard. We could have done the backend parts earlier and reached out to instructional staff earlier in the process. Our team could have also assigned not only stories relating to specific features, but also explorative tasks that involve finding the right backend, how a feature should work, or requirements gathering.

### **Sprint 3 Planning Meeting:**

Date: 4/17/2024
Time: 10:30 AM 
Place: Zachry Engineering Building

Discussion Summary/Breakdown:

In this meeting, team 902-3 of CSCE 331 understood the shortfalls of the last sprint and successes and wanted to move forward to completion of the project in its entirety. As Sprint 3 is the last sprint, we wanted to near completion as much as physically possible. Specifically, with the instruction of the teaching assistant, we looked at the requirements from the canvas final project completion assignment, and crafted our tasks to make sure we hit all of them, include backlog activities, and add above and beyonds as necessary.

We also are making shorter and nuanced stories so that tasks are more compartmentalized and we understand what we need to do as a group, as we were confused in previous sprints due to large and vague sprints. Specifically, this sprint we want to implement a complete menu for customers, cashiers, and managers, as well as complete the manager view analytics.

The Scrum mastersâ€™ specific goals are to complete the assigned tasks that are not coding related, like note taking, and the documentation of the code.

During this meeting we discussed the pending tasks because we needed to make sure everything was working for the TA demo the week after, specifically we discussed how to make the UI work with the backend. The backend was updated to render.com by Rahul, and this will be used by the other developers in the team. Riley is working on the manager's view. Rahul is updating the customer layouts. Diego is helping connect the backend using Axios, but is struggling to implement the refresh functionality.

There was progress made towards the project requirements, specifically the Kitchen functionality that was a requirement made known to us by the TA. Rahul and Elvis are working on the frontend functionality of the Kitchen screen. Diego is helping other team members figure out how to interact with the API but is struggling with the auto-refresh function. Scrum master Rushil helped other team members fix the auto-refresh function by using an inbuilt function that handles refreshing APIs every 30 seconds. We also discussed how to improve the performance of the website as Rileyâ€™s front end was taking a long time to render.

We planned what we are going to do for the rest of the weekend and to solve some blockers. Specifically we planned to solve the blocker of the long rendering times by loading some data temporarily and then only asking the backend when necessary, or troubleshooting the problem by using developer tools to see where the hang ups are really happening. Rushil will be working on the documentation, and the weather API. Riley is still working on the manager's view and needs help from Diego on how to call the backend, which will be their future task. Rahul is working on customer view and kitchen view.
